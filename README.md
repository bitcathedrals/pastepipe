# pastepipe.py

pastepipe copies stdin to stdout and saves a copy of the buffer
and uploads it to pastebin.com.

It expects only a name argument and a key specified as
--key=<key>

or in a  ~/.pastebin file with one line containing the key.

The easiest way to use this is to simply copy the file
and make sure you have requests installed in python.

The build system is a bit more complex and I will cover it
later.
